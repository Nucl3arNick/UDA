      <h2>Feelings towards his homeland and the middle class</h2>
      <p id="para">The novel is part of a moment in time in which, novels as a genre, was on the rise. The poet was seen as the spokesperson of the middle class, whom also exalted it’s virtues and skills. Therefore, Crusoe himself, is the stereotypical middle class hero, tailor-made to appeal to said audience. 
      </p>

      <p id="para">The opening of the novel gives interesting insight to Defoe’s, and consequently, Crusoe’s, view of society. By reading “I was born of a good family” we can already get a taste of the glorification of the middle class.</p>

      <p id="para">“The middle of two extremes, between the mean and the great;”     -verses 36-37
      </p>

      <p id="para">The upper station of low life, the middle state of labour and suffering and the pride and ambition. Though these words are from Crusoe’s father, they already convey the power and exposition the middle class held. But, what is probably most important, is how Robinson decides to live on the deserted island. 
      </p>

      <p id="para">The society created on the island is not an alternative to the English one, but rather, a magnified version of it. This tells us that Crusoe revered his society, so much so to recreate it and sharing it with the natives. </p>

      <p id="para">Overall Robinson Kreutznaer is a man who loves his homeland and that higly respects the middle class, a hard working group of people that can achieve anything through sheer will power.
